# GA-Final_Project
Portfolio
My project is to create a portfolio website that showcases my design work, with a primary focus on UX/UI design. The website will feature an interactive homepage, offering a glimpse of my profile and providing convenient links to explore some of the projects I have worked on. Additionally, I aim to create at least one dedicated project page, and if time permits, I aspire to include even more project pages, allowing me to present a diverse range of my work.
